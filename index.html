           <head><h1><bold>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</bold></h1></head>
           <p>Hi! Thank you for taking time to review my portfolio. A little bit about me: I started my working life when I was 16. I was a cashier at Hardee's and Red Burrito. By 
            the time I was 19, I worked my way to General Manager. I was pretty proud of this position. I was getting the necessary experience with people, hiring, training, inventory, food safety,
            and budgeting. I loved this job...until I didn't. I was working a lot of hours with no work/life balance. That's when I decided that I didn't want to be a GM anymore. I needed
            a better balance to my life. I had joined the national guard when I was in high school so I decided when I didn't want to be a GM anymore, I was going to find active army job postings
            to go work. I did that for a while. I worked at Ft. McClellen for a while and then I went to the Texas boarder for a while. When I was finshed with those orders, I decided I wanted to do 
            more for myself. I was 24 years old with a college degree in civil engineering with experience from the army and as a general manager of a fast food chain. So, I did what anyone else would do
            and got my CDL with Fedex. I was a part time driver for about a year when I decided I needed a change. I wanted to be apart of something bigger. Not just a small portion of this operation. 
            I went full time as a driver. I learned way more, did a lot more, had more experiences. But the hours as a swing driver were terrible. I was working my maximum DOT hours every week. I was burt out.
            At that time, the PM dispatcher stepped down from his position which opened up a new opportunity for me. A new challenge. Something exciting. Plus, it was a steady schedule so I could plan a life around work. 
            I had my interview and actually got the position. As a dispatcher, I was responsible for all the drivers on the night side. I had to ensure all drivers had necessary equpipment such as 
            tractors, trailers, LEO's, paperwork, etc. I was in charge of assigning pick up's and deliveries to drivers depending on what location they were covering. I created weekly schedules for drivers. 
            Ensured all training was completed by drivers. Reviewed all drivers 'Hours of Service' to make sure no one was in violation. With all these responsiblities, I was still not completely happy. I was bored. 
            I was in a rut. So, I did what anyone else would have done and I signed up for a coding bootcamp through TrueCoders. This was the challenge! This is what got my braining thinking in ways
            I've never thought before. This is what I needed in my life. My whole world opened up in fornt of me as I started working on C#, then SQL, and now HTML. I can't wait to finish this program  so I can
            begin my new career as a software developer.</p>
